# Signal Processing TES601
This is the unoffical Solent University Code Repo.

It SHOULD be used to collaborate, help and collect useful code and snippets for the Signal Processing unit.
Strictly **MATLAB, Python, Data and Markdown** files only.

Please use appropriate repos (not just master) and maintain proper [Git ettiquette](https://guides.github.com/) :)

Enjoy!
